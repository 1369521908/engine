- glapi.c
    -   functions to load the OpenGL pointers from dll/shared object
        glapiLoad()
        glapiVersion()
        glapiProc()
        ...
    -   declarations of all the pointers which will be loaded as "static"
    -   definitions of OpenGL functions which will be called by Go.
        These functions call the POINTERS loaded previously.
        Have the names of the original OpenGL functions declared in "glcorearb.h"

- glapi.h
    -   declarations of loader functions Only

- glqueue.c

- gl.go
    -   Declaration of all OpenGL defines as constants
    -   Go function which call the loader api:
        ApiLoad()

    -   Go functions which calls the respective OpenGL functions
